                <p>My name is Justin Tsai and I am currently a sophmore attending 
                Dublin High school. I enjoy biology and the life sciences, so I hope
                to one day become a general physician. Becoming a doctor has been my 
                goal for a long time because my mother, who is a dentist, has inspired me
                to also go into the medical field. In order to achieve this goal, I often
                volunteer my time at medical clinics or my mom's office to get some more 
                experience and to see how the professionals operate. The health field has always 
                fascinated me and I hope to employ some of the coding skills that I have learned
                in my computer science engineering class to my future job. In the future, I hope to
                attend UCLA as my undergraduate school and UCSF as a graduate school for my professional 
                degree. To reach my goals, I must be diligent and continue to work hard throughout high school
                to maintain my grades. Academics are very important to me and I always prioritize schoolwork 
                above everything else. </p>
                
                <p>One of the most prominent characteristics of myself is that I have perseverance. 
                When things are tough, I always find a way to push through and endure. This skill is what
                has allowed me to be an active athlete who practices for over 30 hours a week and a student who 
                maintains a respectable grade point average. In addition to swimming outside of school, I also play
                the piano, clarinet, and violin because I have a passion for music. I work as a part time life guard 
                in Pleasanton at the Dolores Bengston Aquatics Center for the last year. Doing lifeguarding has taught me 
                to be responsible and that my consequences have actions because if someone is not vigilant when they are 
                on duty, then a multitude of disasters can happen. When I am not working or trying to better myself,
                I enjoy relaxing at home with my two sisters, Emily and Sabrina. They look up to me as a role model and we 
                have been playing video games or basketball with each other since childhood. As a big brother, I do my best to 
                protect my little sisters and teach them the difference between right and wrong. </p>
                
                <p>I am also a member of the Dublin High Swimming Team and went to the North Coast Section competition in my 
                first year on the team. Being on the team has brought me closer to many of my fellow students and I hope to continue
                to make friends when the sophmore season starts. One of my dreams is also to be a captain of the swim team because I want 
                to be able to represent my school and lead my fellow students to victory. Although taking a position of leadership
                is not easy, I want to challenge myself to reach greater heights and push myself out of my comfort zone. I believe that 
                self motivation and self improvement are necessary skills of people who are successful. Other than participating in school sports, I also 
                am a member of the KEY club which volunteers their time at centers for those who are less fortunate. In the future, perhaps in my junior
                year, I will start a club of my own to help the less fortunate. If you wish to know more about me and my skillset, then I encourage you to 
                continue to browse around my website! </p>
