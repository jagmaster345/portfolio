            <h2>MIT App Inventor Project</h2>
            <h3>September 2017-October 2017 Computer Science Engineering</h3>
            <p align="center">The objective of this project was to remix an premade project on MIT 
            App Inventor. My team chose to remix a basic version of the Google Maps app and we added
            in a translator, voice command, changed the layout to make it more aesthetically 
            pleasing, and got rid of the data aggregator. The project was done for my computer 
            science engineering class and ran from September 19th to October 6th. My role in the 
            project was to write all the code for the remix of the game while my partner created a 
            log of our progress along with changes that we made. Initially, there were some 
            conflicts between my partner and I because there was a disparity in the amount of work being done by 
            each person; however, as the project went on and our communication got better, all the problems were 
            resolved. Projects were graded based on a 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wfz6ZMU6gUYuBKOPbIQ9qQtfNuOjzAsGTHJdqGx0tBI/edit">rubric</a> 
            that determined how different the new project was from the original and how innovative our new app was. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp9_swt29piCMyCC8rl4iVvOa2mhee1q0ZmHlknJ0ok/edit">Instructions</a> are 
            linked here so you can see the requirements and restrictions of our project.</p>
